# wiser
Welcome! Wiser is a python package designed to free the developers from the burden of common operations with cloud technologies. 

It comes with several straight-forward high-level interfaces that just work! You won't need to care about the underlying 
infrastructure layer, of the client connections or the data management. _wiser_ will handle everything for you. 

The aim of _wiser_ is of allowing the developers to focus on the business logic that they have to develop and not on 
coding for simple operations such as writing a file to Storage, reading or writing to the database.
